Sorry, it's kind of a mess. CN_Code will allow you to recreate the paper, where the joint probability distribution of forward and reverse-time causal states has been solved separately. To do the more general case: PIB_fromForwardEM_Quaternary uses the mixed state presentation algorithm on something with a four-symbol emission alphabet, which could be modified for a binary alphabet or any finite-sized alphabet. The greater the alphabet size, the worse the compute time and memory required.
